JTrana is a Java-based NS2 Wireless Trace Analyzer. It was developed by me and Mr. Hengheng Qian when we worked together as MSc students at Beihang University, China in year 2007.

You can visit its [homepage](https://sites.google.com/site/ns2trana/) and [old sf page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jtrana/).

Hope it helps!
